Planetidal is a idle game made in GMS2 and ported to HTML5.

It is a game about building your own solar system bit by bit, unlocking new planets and new interactions between them.

At the current moment the game features four "planets":
- the Star
- Alpha
- Pool
- Vulcun

The Game's content also includes a simple but complicated Prestige system, the Anomaly.

The game has saving and loading through files, as well as offline progression!
Support the dev: https://ko-fi.com/stardustaurora so that the game gets on steam because html5 is painful.

Game inspired by Fundamental by aaWhy.
