Planetidal is a idle game made in GMS2 and ported to HTML5.

It is a game about building your own solar system bit by bit, unlocking new planets and new interactions between them.

At the current moment the game features two "planets":
- the Star
- Alpha

The game has saving and loading through strings, but it isn't available on firefox due to Game engine issues.
Support the dev: https://ko-fi.com/stardustaurora so that the game gets on steam because html5 is painful.

Game inspired by Fundamental by aaWhy.

Current roadmap:
- Finish Alpha
- Add Ring 2 with Triton and Vulcun
- Add the Prestige Mechanic ( :) )
